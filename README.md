Built Decision Tree and Random Forest models using the Heart Disease dataset. Preprocessed data, controlled tree depth, visualized the Decision Tree, and evaluated both models with accuracy and cross-validation. Analyzed feature importance using Scikit-learn in Google Colab.

#  Task 5: Decision Tree and Random Forest

Built Decision Tree and Random Forest models using the Heart Disease dataset.  
Preprocessed data, controlled tree depth, visualized the Decision Tree, and evaluated both models with accuracy and cross-validation.  
Analyzed feature importance using Scikit-learn in Google Colab.

##  Technologies Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Graphviz

---

##  Files Included
- `task5.ipynb` – Complete Colab notebook
- `heart.csv` – Dataset used (if uploaded)
- `decision_tree.pdf` – Exported tree visualization (optional)
- `README.md` – This file

##  Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Cross-Validation
- Feature Importance Plot

---

##  Dataset
[Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

---

##  Output
Both models were evaluated on performance, and Random Forest showed better generalization. Feature importance revealed key predictors like `cp`, `thalach`, and `exang`.
